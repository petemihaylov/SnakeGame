# SnakeGame

![Snake Game](./snake.png)

Classic Snake game for the terminal, made with C and ncurses. Guide the snake to eat the food and grow, while avoiding collisions with its own body!

## Features
- **Boundary Wrapping**: The snake wraps around the screen edges, reappearing on the opposite side.
- **Self-Collision Detection**: Game ends only when the snake collides with itself.
- **Timed Food Regeneration**: Food regenerates every 7 seconds if uneaten.

## Dependencies
Install the ncurses library if you don't already have it:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

## Controls
| Key             | Action               |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| **a**           | Move Left            |
| **w**           | Move Up              |
| **d**           | Move Right           |
| **s**           | Move Down            |
| **q**           | Quit the Game        |

   ./snake
   ```

Enjoy the game in your terminal!

*Note*: This game was built as a fun exercise in C programming and terminal-based graphics with `ncurses`. Feel free to explore and modify the code for added functionality!
